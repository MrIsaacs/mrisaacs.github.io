We are moving to a world, ...moving to a world where normal ordinary folks have now access to all the same information as institutional organized capital and they will come to many of the same conclusions. sometimes at the same time, oftentimes faster and sometimes to the opposite conclusions and sometimes at the same time sometimes faster. You will see more volatility like this in the future.
